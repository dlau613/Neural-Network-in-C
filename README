Neural Network Implemented in C

Authors: Daniel Lau and Ben Quachtran

95.43% accuracy using 800 Hidden Nodes

Using it to recognize Hand Written Digits.  Training with 60000 digits from MNIST database.
14 Output Nodes (plan on expanding it to recognize +,-,x,/)

However it can easily be adjusted to recognize other patterns by changing a couple parameters.

Based off of feed-forward back-propagation Algorithm detailed at http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jxb/NN/nn.html. 

Works with 2D images, but can easily be adapted for 1D datasets.
