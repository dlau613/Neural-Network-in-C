Neural Network Implemented in C

95.43% accuracy using 800 Hidden Nodes

Using it to recognize Hand Written Digits.  Training with 10000 digits from MNIST database.
14 Output Nodes (plan on expanding it to recognize +,-,x,/)

However it can easily be adjusted to recognize other patterns by changing a couple parameters.
